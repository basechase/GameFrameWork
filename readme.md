# raygame - sample project

This is a sample C++ project setup with [raylib][raylib] for Visual
Studio 2019. This sample is used to demonstrate steering components, as well as a finite state machine.

The player is to control the spaceship with WASD keys while the enemy decides to seek, flee, wander or evade.
