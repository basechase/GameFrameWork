# raygame - sample project

This is a sample C++ project setup with [raylib][raylib] for Visual
Studio 2019. This sample is used to demonstrate steering components, seek, flee, and avoid. 
As well as a finite state machine to swap between states.

The player is to control the spaceship with WASD keys while the enemy decides to seek, flee, wander or evade.
